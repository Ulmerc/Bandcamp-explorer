# Bandcamp-explorer

Bandcamp is a wonderful site where artists upload their music for sale. This application gives you a link to a random album from the site. The album can either be purely random, or you can select a specific tag for the random album. This is good for when you want to listen to some new music, but are not sure what to try next! 

## Getting started

This project uses Python 3.4.3 as well as the libraries bs4 and urllib.request. It is a terminal based application. The program will prompt you with a few questions then will provide you a link.

## Inspiration 

After listening to the episode "Bubble-Hopping (Reality Part 2)" from the podcast "Invisibilia" where a software engineer created an application to randomly select public events to attend in order to expand his interests and experiences, I applied this idea to my smaller challange of wanting to listen to new music but not really having any direction.
